Introduction
============

LISO (**LI**\ nac **S**\ imulation and **O**\ ptimization) is a library which provides
a unified interface for numerical simulations, experiments and data management
in the era of big data and artificial intelligence. LISO was initially created only
for simulation and optimization back in 2017. After a more than two years interruption,
it is live again but aims at:

1. providing a high-level API to run a large numbers of beam dynamics simulations using a combination
of different codes;

2. providing a unified IO for the simulated and experimental data;

3. providing an interface for deep learning and deep reinforcement learning studies on accelerator physics.
